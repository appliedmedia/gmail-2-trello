# Background Agent Branch Cleanup
When a background agent task completes:
- If the branch has no commits beyond the base branch: delete both local and remote branches
- Check with: git rev-list --count HEAD ^main (if 0, delete the branch)
- Delete with: git checkout main && git branch -D <branch> && git push origin --delete <branch> 2>/dev/null || true
